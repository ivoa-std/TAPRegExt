This directory contains the source to the TAPRegExt IVOA standard.  
TAPRegExt-v*.xsd is the schema itself. 

dumprecord.py is a program that generates sample.xml from the capabilities
record for the TAP service of GAVO DaCHS.  It will thus only work if
you have GAVO DaCHS installed, and you will most certainly not want that
for the purpose of building this document.  So, don't touch sample.xml or
dumprecord.py.

The document source is in tapregext.html.  It is meant to be processed
by Paul Harrison's ivoadoc package.  To build a package, say

ant formatdoc
(due to a bug in ivoadoc, you'll have to remove an empty UploadMetod 
Metadata Elements table or createPDF will fail.  Plus, fix the bug...)
ant createPDF
ant package
