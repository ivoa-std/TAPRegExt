This directory contains the source to the TAPRegExt IVOA standard.  
TAPRegExt-v*.xsd is the schema itself. 

spec.xsl.in contains the source of the standards document within an XSL
stylesheet template.  See the Makefile for how this template is
combined with sample.xml and the schema to form spec.xsl, that in
turn is formatted into spec.html using again the schema and the
vor2* files due to Ray Plante.

dumprecord.py is a program that generates sample.xml from the capabilities
record for the TAP service of GAVO DaCHS.  It will thus only work if
you have GAVO DaCHS installed, and you will most certainly not want that
for the purpose of building this document.  So, don't touch sample.xml or
dumprecord.py.
